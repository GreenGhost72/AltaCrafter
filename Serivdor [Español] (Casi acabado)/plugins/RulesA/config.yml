# If you don't want to use the Rank portion of this plugin, and only want to use the
# plugin as a fancy way to display your /rules. Set this to true. Upon completing /rules
# the player will still receive any and all rewards, but will be set to "has read the rules"
# and won't receive them again.
# (Default: false)
No Rank Up: true

# When running the /rules command, I send blank lines to "clear" the chat of the player, so his focus is
# on the rules being presented. The amount of "blank lines" I send is controlled here. If you don't want
# any blank lines, use 0. Otherwise, just play with this number until you get results you like.
# (Default: 10)
Line Breaks: 10

# Should we send a message to a new player when they join? This will create clear the players screen.
# You can add any message you like here, but I suggest something along the lines of informing them to
# type /rules to get promoted. Anything else you like is up to you.

# (Default: 2)
Welcome Delay: 2

# If set to true, this message is sent to a player. Don't worry, it's formatted very nicely. Like the rules
